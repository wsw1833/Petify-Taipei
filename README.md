### \*_Introducing Petify - Decentralized Animal Health Profiles & Trustworthy Pet Care on ETH Taipei_

**Petify** is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages Web3 blockchain technology to create **unique, immutable digital profiles** for animals. By combining **Soulbound NFTs (RMRK)**, **AI-generated retro pixel art** , and **decentralized storage (IPFS)**, Petify revolutionizes how pet owners, veterinarians, and animal organizations manage and interact with animal health records and ownership data. This project bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, offering a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for the global pet care ecosystem.

### **Problem Statement**

The current system for managing animal health records and ownership is **fragmented, insecure, and inefficient**. Pet owners often rely on **paper-based records** that can be easily lost or damaged, while veterinarians and shelters struggle with inaccessible or incomplete data. Additionally, there is no standardized way to verify pet ownership, leading to disputes and challenges in proving provenance. These issues result in:

- **Lost or incomplete health records**, putting pets at risk during emergencies.
- **Lack of transparency** in pet ownership, enabling theft and fraud.
- **Inefficient workflows** for veterinarians and shelters, increasing administrative burdens.
- **Limited trust** between pet owners, veterinarians, and other stakeholders.

Petify addresses these challenges by providing a **decentralized, tamper-proof solution** that ensures secure and transparent management of animal profiles and health records.

### **Inspiration**

The inspiration for Petify comes from the **growing need for innovation in the pet care industry** and the potential of blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. The pet care market is booming, yet it lacks modern, digital solutions for managing pet data.

The rise of Web3 technologies, such as Soulbound NFTs (RMRK) and decentralized storage (IPFS), inspired us to create a platform that not only secures pet data but also fosters trust, transparency, and community engagement. Additionally, the popularity of retro pixel art and the capabilities of AI tools motivated us to design a visually appealing and engaging user experience that resonates with pet owners.

### **Solution**

Petify provides a comprehensive, blockchain-based solution to the challenges of pet health record management and ownership verification. Our platform offers:

1. **Immutable Digital Profiles:**
   - Each pet is assigned a **unique digital profile** stored on the blockchain, ensuring data security and transparency.
   - Profiles include health records (vaccinations, deworming, grooming), metadata (breed, age, weight), and ownership details.
2. **Soulbound NFTs (RMRK)**:
   - Pets are represented as Soulbound NFTs, permanently linking them to their owners and ensuring provenance and accountability.
   - These NFTs are **non-transferable**, making them ideal for ownership verification.
3. **AI-Generated Retro Pixel Art:**
   - Using **Stability.ai**, Petify generates **unique, retro pixel art** for each pet, enhancing the visual appeal of profiles and creating a personalized experience for users.
4. **Decentralized Storage (IPFS):**
   - Pet identification and medical records are stored on **IPFS**, ensuring immutability and accessibility while reducing reliance on centralized servers.
